# Google Workspace — through the owner's Mac

This agent holds no Google credential. There is no local OAuth token
(no `google_token.json` exists in this home), and local Google OAuth
scripts from older copies of this skill do not work here. Never run
them and never start a local Google OAuth setup flow.

Gmail and Google Calendar are reached through the owner's Mac, over
the Plow relay MCP server. Identify it by its tools, not by its
name: it is the configured MCP server whose tool names start with
`plow_`, and that server's own name differs between installs.

1. Call `plow_list_skills`. If it lists `google-workspace`, read it
   with `plow_read_skill` and follow it exactly. That skill is the
   only source for the command and its arguments — do not carry a
   spelling from memory or from this file. The Mac mints its own
   short-lived Google token; you never see or need one.
2. A command may show the owner an approval card on their Mac. If a
   command hangs, tell the owner it is waiting on an approval there;
   if it comes back refused, report it as denied on the Mac.
3. If no MCP server with `plow_*` tools is connected, or it lists no
   `google-workspace` skill, Google is not available to this agent.
   Say exactly that — do not fall back to local OAuth.
